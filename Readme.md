# Snake Game
Welcome to the classic Snake game implemented in Java!  

## Project Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface. The objective of the game is to control the snake, collect apples, and avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The game also features a high score system that remembers the highest score achieved across game sessions.

# Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Score tracking 
- High score persistence 
- Bonus apples that appear every fifth apple and must be eaten within 5 seconds to earn extra points
- Simple, intuitive controls
- Retro-inspired graphics
## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each apple increases your score by 1 point.
Every fifth apple is a bonus apple. You must eat the bonus apple within 5 seconds to earn 5 extra points.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
## High Score Feature
The game saves the highest score achieved in a file named highscore.dat in the project directory.
The high score is displayed on the game screen during gameplay and at the end of the game.
